# Mandala Designer project

This project is carried out as part of the Complex Embedded Systems Lab Training (Sommersemester 2017/2018).
It consists of building a Mini CNC Plotter using Arduino. The final machine can draw basic shapes, texts and even complex figures as long as the input is G-Code.

# Hardware requirement :

1. Two old DVD/CD drives
2. A servo motor
3. A motor shield L293D
4. Arduino Uno board
5. Cables
6. USB 2.0 cable to connect Arduino to PC
7. Screws and nuts
8. Power supply ([see Ardafruit tutorial on powering motor shield](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield-v2-for-arduino/powering-motors))

# Software requirement :

1. Arduino IDE
2. Processing IDE
3. Inkscape (optional)
4. GCTRL processing program from [Damellis](https://github.com/damellis/gctrl/blob/master/gctrl.pde). It is used to send G-Code data to Arduino
